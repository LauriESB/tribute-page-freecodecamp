                <h2 id="life-death">Life</h2>
                    <p>Nathan Jonas Jordison was born on April 26th, 1975, in Des Moines, Iowa. His passion for music became evident at 
                    a young age when he discovered bands like Kiss and Black Sabbath during the early Eighties. Encouraged by his parents, 
                    Nathan delved deeper into his musical interests.</p>
                    <p>In elementary school, Nathan formed his first band, initially taking on the role of a guitarist. However, upon realizing 
                    his friend's lack of skill on the drums, he made the decision to switch instruments. This change ignited his passion 
                    for drumming. To his delight, his parents surprised him with his very own drum kit when he was in fifth grade, further fueling his musical journey.</p>
                    <p>The origins of Slipknot trace back to Des Moines' club circuit, where Jordison and the other original members first connected. By 1996, they had adopted 
                    their signature masks and released a demo album titled Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. This early work featured a track titled "Slipknot," which later evolved into 
                    the iconic "(sic)" on their debut album. Jordison recalled the inspiration behind his first mask, stating, "The first mask I had was an original pale-white kabuki 
                    mask. One Halloween, when I was about eight years old, I came home from school and my mother popped around the corner with that mask on and a long robe and scared the living fuck out of me. It’s always stuck with me. So I had to use that for my mask." </p>
                    <p>Slipknot's self-titled debut album was released in 1999. Thanks to their participation in Ozzfest and the success of singles like "Wait and Bleed" and "Spit It Out," the album achieved platinum status within a year. Reflecting on their early days, 
                    Jordison recounted, "I was a night manager at a Sinclair gas station from ’95 to ’97. That’s where most of Slipknot was conceived. In 2016, he revealed that he had been dismissed from Slipknot three years earlier, citing a misunderstanding regarding his health issues.</p>
                    <p><em> “They got confused about my health issues and obviously even I didn’t know what it was at first,” he told Metal Hammer. “They thought I was fucked up on drugs, which I wasn’t at all. I’ve been through so many things with those guys, and I love them very much. What’s hurtful is the way it went down was not fucking right."</em></p>
                    <p>Joey Jordison's drumming technique was not just good; it was groundbreaking and influential in shaping the landscape of modern metal drumming. His skill and innovation revolutionized the use of double bass drumming, setting a new standard for speed and precision that inspired countless drummers and bands, his ability to seamlessly integrate complex foot 
                    patterns with intricate hand work elevated Slipknot's music to new heights, setting them apart from their contemporaries in the nu-metal scene.</p>
                    <p> His choice of gear and tuning, characterized by a raw and aggressive sound, complemented the band's intense and chaotic aesthetic. By opting for a snare with a sharp, cutting tone and toms that 
                    decayed rapidly, Jordison ensured that his drumming cut through the dense layers of instrumentation, contributing to Slipknot's signature sound.</p>
                    <p>Despite sharing the stage with multiple musicians, Jordison's drumming remained dynamic and expressive. He demonstrated remarkable speed, effortlessly navigating intricate fills and rhythms while maintaining a powerful and commanding presence behind the kit. His ability to blend technical prowess with musicality 
                    allowed him to execute complex patterns with precision and finesse, earning him widespread acclaim among fans and fellow musicians alike.</p>
                    <p>Jordison's drumming legacy extends far beyond his tenure with Slipknot, as his influence continues to resonate in the world of metal music. His innovative techniques and fearless approach to drumming have inspired a new generation of drummers, ensuring that his impact on the genre will endure for years to come.</p>

                <h2 id="life-death">Death</h2>
                    <p>In 2013, Joey departed from Slipknot, citing "personal reasons." However, a few years later, 
                    he disclosed the true reason for his departure: a debilitating neurological disease known as 
                    transverse myelitis. At the Metal Hammer Golden Awards in 2016, he revealed the extent of his illness, stating:  </p>
                    <p><em>"I couldn’t play anymore. It was a form of multiple sclerosis, which I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. I got 
                    myself back up, and I got myself in the gym and I got myself back in fucking therapy to fucking beat this shit".</em></p>
                    <p>Tragically, Joey passed away on July 26, 2021, at the age of 46,  under circumstances that remain undisclosed, 
                    leaving a void in the hearts of those who knew him. His family released a statement remembering Joey for his quick 
                    wit, gentle demeanor, immense heart, and passion for family and music. They requested privacy and understanding during 
                    this difficult time and planned a private funeral service to honor Joey's memory</p>
